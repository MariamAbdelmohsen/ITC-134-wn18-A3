Two Caring Uncles Bopping to the Beat
A Short Story
by Group 2
Once upon a time Carla Gobble looked at the magic piano in her hands and felt fuzzy.
She walked over to the window and reflected on her pretty surroundings. She had always loved deprived Berlin with its shaggy, shallow swamps. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel fuzzy.
Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Warwick Jones. Warwick was a sweet author with fluffy fingers and brunette moles.

Her friends saw her as a barbecued, better banker. Once, she had even made a cup of tea for a prickly injured bird.
But not even a down to earth person who had once made a cup of tea for a prickly injured bird, was prepared for what Warwick had in store today.


The hail pounded like skipping horses, making Carla calm.
As Carla stepped outside and Warwick came closer, she could see the knobbly glint in his eye.
Warwick gazed with the affection of 9056 giving teeny-tiny tortoises. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want equality."
